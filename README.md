### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Grace, a senior at Barnard College studying Computer Science and English. My research interests lie at the intersection of NLP, AI, and HCI. I primarily focus on building systems that explore user interactions to improve science commmunication, creative thinking, and productive struggle. I will be an incoming Ph.D Student at UChicago this Fall working with Professor Mina Lee on Human-AI collaboration and writing support tools.
