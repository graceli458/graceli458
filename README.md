### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Grace, a first-year PhD student at UChicago working with Professor Mina Lee on Human-AI collaboration and writing support tools. My research seeks to understand how technology can be used to deepen student learning. I focus on two main aspects: (1) fostering curiosity, and (2) maintaining resilience in the face of challenges.
